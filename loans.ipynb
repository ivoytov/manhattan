Both events triggered thousands of times so this is a robust sample - but do note that there is some overlap in the events. There were more long than short events. The long trades generated a median return of 4 bps in the reasonably short holding period, while the short trades lost 2 bps. This is before trading fees, which on a $1B+ loan can be estimated at ~30 bps each side (60bps round trip)."
